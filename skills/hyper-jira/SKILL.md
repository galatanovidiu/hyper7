  Integrates Jira with the Hyper workflow. Imports a Jira issue by key, seeds
  the Hyper intake from Jira data (title, description, acceptance criteria,

# hyper-jira

Integrate Jira with the Hyper workflow.

Before anything else, resolve the Hyper state root per
`../hyper-build/reference/state-root.md`. All `.hyper/` paths are relative to that root.

**No-op rule:** all operations except `init` check for `.hyper/jira.md` first.
When absent, print:
`"Jira not configured. Run: hyper-jira init <base_url> --project <key>"` and
stop (exit 0).

**Mode detection:** after reading `.hyper/jira.md`, read the `mode` field
(default: `mcp`). All Jira API operations branch on this value:

- `mcp` — use the agent's installed Jira MCP tools. Operations are described by
  intent; the agent resolves the correct MCP tool name from its available surface.
- `docker` — make direct HTTP REST API calls to `docker_url` from `.hyper/jira.md`
  using Basic auth. Read credentials from env vars `JIRA_USER` and `JIRA_TOKEN`.
  If either env var is unset in docker mode, print:
  `"JIRA_USER and JIRA_TOKEN must be set in your environment for docker mode."`
  and stop.

**Jira API calls by mode** (reference table for all operations):

| Action | MCP mode | Docker mode |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| Fetch issue | Get issue by key via MCP | `GET {docker_url}/rest/api/2/issue/{KEY}` with Basic auth |
| Fetch comments | Get issue comments via MCP | `GET {docker_url}/rest/api/2/issue/{KEY}/comment` |
| Transition status | Transition issue via MCP | `POST {docker_url}/rest/api/2/issue/{KEY}/transitions` body `{"transition":{"name":"<name>"}}` |
| Add comment | Add comment via MCP | `POST {docker_url}/rest/api/2/issue/{KEY}/comment` body `{"body":"<text>"}` |
| Verify connectivity | Get current user or project via MCP | `GET {docker_url}/rest/api/2/myself` with Basic auth |

Read the user's request and pick exactly one operation: `init`, `import`,
`comment`, or `status`.

## init

`hyper-jira init <base_url> --project <key> [--mode <mcp|docker>] [--docker-url <url>] [--done-transition <name>] [--auto-branch] [--branch-from <branch>] [--auto-commit]`

1. If `--mode docker` is specified and `--docker-url` is not provided, print:
   `"--docker-url is required when using --mode docker."` and stop.
2. Write `.hyper/jira.md` from `templates/jira-config.md`, filling:
   - `base_url` from the positional argument
   - `default_project` from `--project`
   - `done_transition` from `--done-transition` (default: `QA Test`)
   - `mode` from `--mode` (default: `mcp`)
   - `docker_url` from `--docker-url` (include this field only when mode is `docker`)
   - `auto_branch: true` only when `--auto-branch` flag is present (omit field otherwise)
   - `branch_from` from `--branch-from` only when `--auto-branch` is present (default: `dev`)
   - `auto_commit: true` only when `--auto-commit` flag is present (omit field otherwise)
3. Report: `Jira integration initialized. mode: <mode>. base_url: <url>. Project: <key>.`

No credentials are written to `.hyper/jira.md`. The file is safe to commit.

## import

Triggered when the user provides a Jira issue key matching pattern
`[A-Z]{2,10}-\d+` (e.g., `PROJ-123`, `AUTH-45`). Supports an optional
`--yolo` flag: `hyper-jira import PROJ-123 --yolo`.

1. Check `.hyper/jira.md`. If absent: no-op rule applies.
2. Read `base_url`, `default_project`, `done_transition`, and `mode`.
3. Fetch the Jira issue by key (mode-appropriate call). Extract:
   - `summary`, `description`, `issuetype.name`, `priority.name`, `status.name`
   - `reporter.displayName`
   - Acceptance criteria: check `customfield_10016`; if absent, scan the
     description for an "Acceptance Criteria" heading.
   - Epic link: try `customfield_10014` first (correct for Jira Server/DC and
     docker mode). If absent, try `parent.key` where `parent.issuetype.name ==
     "Epic"` (Cloud next-gen fallback).
   - All comments: capture author, created timestamp, and body.
     In docker mode, fetch comments separately (see table).
4. If `issuetype.name` is `"Epic"`: print
   `"Cannot import a Jira Epic as a Hyper task. Use hyper-task epic create to
   create a Hyper epic, then import individual issues."` and stop.
5. Map issue type to scope and bugfix flag:

   | Jira type (case-insensitive) | scope | bugfix |
   |------------------------------|-------|--------|
   | Bug, Defect, Incident | feature | true |
   | Story, Task, Improvement, Feature, Change | feature | false |
   | Research, Spike, Investigation, PoC | research | false |
   | Sub-task | feature | false |
   | Any other | feature | false (add note in task body) |

6. Epic handling:
   a. If no epic link found: skip epic enrollment.
   b. If epic link found (a Jira epic key, e.g., `PROJ-42`):
      - Read `.hyper/epics.md` if it exists. Scan the `Source` column for a
        matching Jira epic key.
      - **Match found:** note the existing Hyper epic id (e.g., `E1`).
      - **No match:** append a new row to `epics.md` with `Source = <jira-epic-key>`
        and `Status = planned`. Allocate the next `E<N>`. If `epics.md` does not
        exist, create it including the `Source` column.
7. Determine the next task id by scanning folder names in `tasks/ ∪ archive/`:
   - `T(\d+)-.*` — take the T number; `E\d+T(\d+)-.*` — take the T number.
   - Add 1 to the highest found.
8. Compose the folder name:
   - No epic: `T<N>-<jira-key-lowercased>-<slug>`
   - With epic: `E<M>T<N>-<jira-key-lowercased>-<slug>`
   where `<slug>` is the Jira summary kebab-cased, max 40 chars trimmed at a
   word boundary.
9. Create the task folder. Write `task.md`:
   - `title` = Jira summary
   - `phase` = `research` if scope is research; otherwise `intake`
   - `scope` = derived from step 5
   - `bugfix` = derived from step 5
   - `jira_key` = `<JIRA-KEY>` (uppercase, as-is from Jira)
   - `jira_synced_at` = current timestamp
   - `epic` = `E<M>` if enrolled (omit field when not enrolled)
   - `yolo: true` when the `--yolo` flag was passed (omit the field otherwise).
10. Write the task body:
    - First line: `> Imported from Jira: <JIRA-KEY> — <base_url>/browse/<JIRA-KEY>`
    - Jira `description` as the main body text.
    - If acceptance criteria found separately: add `## Acceptance Criteria` section.
    - `**Reporter:** <reporter.displayName>` line.
    - `## Jira Comments` section with the 5 most recent comments (author, date,
      body). If more than 5 exist, note the total count.
11. Seed `dashboard.md` from `../hyper-build/templates/dashboard.md`, filling
    `## Goal` from the task body.
12. If an epic was enrolled, update the `epics.md` Tasks column to include the
    new task id.
13. (Conditional — only when `auto_branch: true` in `.hyper/jira.md`)
    a. Read `branch_from` from `.hyper/jira.md` (default: `dev`).
    b. Compose branch name: `<JIRA-KEY>-<slug>` using the uppercase Jira key
       and the same slug computed in step 8.
    c. Run `git status --porcelain`. If output is non-empty (dirty working tree):

       If `--yolo` was passed: auto-stash (`git stash`) without prompting, then
       proceed to step 13d as if the tree were clean (create the branch). Skip
       the stash/commit/skip prompt entirely.

       If `--yolo` was not passed: prompt the developer:
       ```
       Working tree has uncommitted changes. Choose:
         1. Stash  — stash changes, create branch, pop stash
         2. Commit — commit current changes first, then create branch
         3. Skip   — import without creating a branch
       ```
       - **Stash:** `git stash && git checkout <branch_from> && git checkout -b <branch> && git stash pop`
       - **Commit:** ask `"Commit message? [default: WIP before <JIRA-KEY>]"`;
         then `git add -A && git commit -m "<msg>" && git checkout <branch_from> && git checkout -b <branch>`
       - **Skip:** proceed to step 14 without branching.
    d. If tree is clean: `git checkout <branch_from> && git checkout -b <branch>`
    e. If `branch_from` does not exist or any git command fails, print:
       `"Branch creation failed: <error>. Continuing import without branch."`
       and proceed to step 14.
14. Transition the Jira issue status to `"In Progress"` (mode-appropriate call).
    If the transition fails, report the error and continue — do not abort task
    creation.
15. Report:
    `Created T<N> — <title> (from <JIRA-KEY>). Jira status set to In Progress.
    Continue with: hyper-build T<N>`

## comment

`hyper-jira comment <text>`

1. Check `.hyper/jira.md`. If absent: no-op rule applies.
2. Identify the target issue key:
   a. If exactly one active task has `jira_key` in its frontmatter, use that key.
   b. If multiple active tasks have `jira_key`, list them and ask the user which
      one to comment on.
   c. If no active task has `jira_key`, report:
      `"No active task is linked to a Jira issue."` and stop.
3. Post `<text>` as a comment on that issue (mode-appropriate call).
4. Report: `Comment posted to <JIRA-KEY>.`

## status

1. Read `.hyper/jira.md`. If absent: print setup hint and stop.
2. Read `base_url`, `default_project`, and `mode`.
3. Verify connectivity (mode-appropriate call):
   - `mcp` mode: fetch current user or project info via MCP.
   - `docker` mode: check `JIRA_USER` and `JIRA_TOKEN` env vars are set;
     `GET {docker_url}/rest/api/2/myself` with Basic auth.
4. Report: `Jira connected. mode: <mode>. base_url: <url>. Project: <key>.`
   On failure, report the error clearly. For docker mode credential errors,
   include: `"Ensure JIRA_USER and JIRA_TOKEN are set in your shell environment."`

description: >
  Manages Hyper tasks outside the execution workflow. Lists active tasks, creates a deferred task, parks an active task back into `phase: deferred`, cancels an in-progress task with a reason, or shows the status of a specific task. Use when the user asks what tasks exist, wants to create work for later, or needs to defer or cancel a task. Keywords: hyper, task, list, status, defer, cancel, create, deferred.

# hyper-task

Manage task state without running the workflow.

Call the state probe once at session start:

    node "<skill-base-dir>/scripts/state.mjs"

`<skill-base-dir>` is the path printed at skill load as "Base directory for this skill". Parse the JSON output and route all subsequent decisions (state root, active tasks, next task id) from its fields. Do not re-scan folders or re-read individual `task.md` frontmatter for routing or id allocation.

The probe implements `reference/state-root.md`. Read `reference/data-model.md` before changing task state.

## Operations

### List

List entries from the probe's `active_tasks` whose `category` is `active` or `deferred`, with:

- id
- title
- phase
- scope
- awaiting

Do not list archived tasks unless the user asks; archived entries live in the probe's `archived_tasks` list.

### Status

Report:

- id and title
- `phase`, `scope`, `created`, `awaiting`
- whether the folder is active or archived
- artifacts present in the folder
- for feature tasks, subtask progress as `<done> of <total> subtasks done`
- for cancelled tasks, `cancelled_at` and `cancelled_reason`

Artifacts of interest:

- `01-intake.md`
- `02-spec.md`
- `03-technical-plan.md`
- `04-execution-plan.md`
- `05-execution-plan-review.md`
- `research.md`
- subtask files
- `checks.md`
- `handoff.md`
- `retro.md`

### Create deferred

Create a tracked task the user does not want to start yet.

1. Use `next_task_id` from the probe output.
2. Derive a short title and slug.
3. Draft the task body from the user's request and optionally carry over a
   `## Why` section when the request already contains a clear motivation.
4. Create `.hyper/tasks/T<N>-<slug>/task.md` from
   `templates/task.md`, using the drafted body and:
   - `phase: deferred`
   - `scope: unknown`
   - `bugfix: false`
   - `awaiting: null`
5. Seed `dashboard.md` from `templates/dashboard.md`, filling `## Goal`
   from the task body and leaving other computed sections as placeholders.
6. Report: `Created T<N> — <title> (deferred). Invoke hyper T<N> when ready.`

Do not start the workflow. Deferred tasks enter `intake` only when the user
starts them through `hyper`.

### Defer

Set an active task back to:

- `phase: deferred`
- `awaiting: null`

Do not delete artifacts. Report the previous phase and next command to resume.

### Cancel

Cancel an active or deferred task with a reason.

1. Confirm the user intended cancellation unless the request is explicit.
2. Set:
   - `phase: cancelled`
   - `awaiting: null`
   - `cancelled_at: <YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS>`
   - `cancelled_reason: <reason>`
3. Move the task folder to `.hyper/archive/`.

Do not cancel archived `done` tasks.

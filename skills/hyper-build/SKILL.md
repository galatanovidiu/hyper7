description: >
  Starts or resumes structured, phase-based development work through the Hyper build workflow. Reads task state under .hyper/, routes the task into the correct phase, and invokes the matching internal Hyper skill. Use when the work is well-defined enough to commit to fixed phases (intake → spec → technical-plan → execution-plan → implement → verify → docs): a fully-specified feature, a non-trivial bug, a refactor, or continuing tracked task work. For exploratory or adaptive work where the path should stay flexible, use the main hyper skill instead. Keywords: hyper, hyper-build, workflow, task, intake, technical plan, execution plan, implement, resume, structured, phased.

# hyper-build

Your job: take the user's request, combine it with `.hyper/` state, decide
whether to create, resume, or ask, then invoke the correct phase skill.

Never implement, test, or review yourself. The phase skills own the work.

## Before anything else

Call the state probe once at session start:

    node "<skill-base-dir>/scripts/state.mjs"

`<skill-base-dir>` is the path printed at skill load as "Base directory for this skill". Parse the JSON output; route all subsequent decisions from its fields (`state_root`, `bootstrapped`, `next_task_id`, `active_tasks`, `archived_tasks`, etc.). Do not re-scan folders or re-read individual `task.md` frontmatter for routing.

The probe implements `reference/state-root.md`; that file is now the probe's contract, not a procedure to walk.

Ensure `.hyper/` is bootstrapped per `reference/bootstrap.md` before any write. Use the probe's `bootstrapped` field as the source of truth.

If `.hyper/rules.md` exists, read it once at session start and treat its
contents as normative project rules for every phase.

When the probe reports `learnings.exists: true`, read `.hyper/memory/index.md`
once at session start and treat its entries as recall hints. Open individual
entry files on demand when an entry looks relevant to the current task; do not
read every entry file up front.

Read `reference/data-model.md` and `reference/gates.md` once per session. This
skill assumes those contracts are active.

## Task categories

For routing, classify tasks by `phase`:

- **Active** — `intake`, `spec`, `technical-plan`, `execution-plan`,
  `implement`, `verify`, `docs`, `research`, `review`
- **Deferred** — `deferred`
- **Terminal** — `done`, `cancelled`

If a task on disk uses unknown phase names or unexpected artifact names, stop
and point the user to `reference/state-recovery.md`. Do not guess a route.

## Routing

The probe's `active_tasks` array carries every task folder under `.hyper/tasks/` regardless of phase — the field name is historical and matches the folder, not the routing category. Before walking the routing checks below, build the two routing buckets from the probe output:

- `active` = `active_tasks.filter(t => t.category === "active")` — these are the only entries that count as "active" for the routing branches.
- `deferred` = `active_tasks.filter(t => t.category === "deferred")`.

Terminal entries (`category: terminal`) under `.hyper/tasks/` are anomalies (the folder was not moved to archive). Surface them to the user separately; do not route them as active.

Three companion integrations activate on the presence of a config file rather
than on probe output: `.hyper/jira.md` (Jira), `.hyper/repo.md` (team sync), and
`.hyper/epics.md` (epics). Check for these by direct file existence — the probe
does not report them. When a file is absent, every behavior below that depends
on it is a no-op.

Walk these checks in order, using `active` and `deferred` as defined above.

### 0. Request is a help invocation

If the user's request is `help`, `--help`, `-h`, `?`, or any short phrase that
asks for a command list or usage reference (e.g. "what commands are there",
"how do I use hyper"), invoke the `hyper-help` skill immediately and stop.

### 1. Request is a task id

Jump to **Resume by id**.

### 2. Reply to an open gate

Inside `active`, pick entries with `awaiting != null`.

- If exactly one active task has an open gate and the user reply is
  substantive, resume that task and jump to **Dispatch phase**.
- If multiple active tasks have open gates and the user did not name an id, ask
  which task the reply belongs to.
- If the user clearly supplied a new unrelated goal, keep going.

### 3. Goal provided, active task, goals clearly match

Resume the active task and jump to **Dispatch phase**.

### 4. Goal provided, active task, goals clearly differ

Ask whether to treat this as new work or fold it into the active task.

### 5. No goal, exactly one active task

When `active.length === 1`, resume it and jump to **Cold-resume check**.

### 6. No goal, multiple active tasks

When `active.length > 1`, list them and ask which to continue.

### 7. No goal, no active task

When `active.length === 0`: if `deferred.length > 0`, tell the user. Otherwise ask what to work on.

### 8. Goal provided, no active task

When `active.length === 0`, apply `reference/intake-triage.md`.

- If it is direct-handling sized, recommend handling it outside Hyper.
- If it is backlog-shaped, recommend `hyper-backlog`.
- Otherwise create a task and start `intake`.

## Resume by id

Given `T<N>`:

1. Look up the id in the probe's `active_tasks` list, then fall back to `archived_tasks`.
2. If `phase: done`, report completion and stop.
3. If `phase: cancelled`, report the cancellation reason and stop.
4. If `phase: deferred`, set `phase: intake`, save, announce the start, and
   continue to **Dispatch phase**.
5. Otherwise continue to **Cold-resume check**.

## Cold-resume check

For active tasks with no open gate:

1. Use durable signals only: older `created`, or `handoff.md` present.
2. Re-read `task.md`, the current phase artifact, and `handoff.md` if present.
3. If the task still looks live, run the Jira resume sync below (if applicable),
   then continue to **Dispatch phase**.
4. If it may be stale or obsolete, stop and ask the user whether to resume,
   defer, or cancel it.

**Jira resume sync** (conditional — only when `task.md` has a `jira_key` field
and `.hyper/jira.md` exists):

Read `mode` from `.hyper/jira.md`. Use the agent's Jira MCP tools if
`mode: mcp`; use direct HTTP REST calls to `docker_url` with env vars
`JIRA_USER`/`JIRA_TOKEN` if `mode: docker`.

1. Re-fetch the Jira issue description and acceptance criteria using `jira_key`.
2. Compare the fetched description with the task body saved in `task.md`. If
   substantive differences exist:
   - When `yolo: true`: apply the update to `task.md` automatically and append
     a note: `> _Jira description auto-updated on resume (YOLO) at
     <timestamp>._` Do not prompt.
   - Otherwise: show a brief diff and ask the developer whether to update
     `task.md` before continuing. If confirmed, update the body; otherwise
     continue with the saved version.
3. Fetch all comments on the Jira issue. Show any comments with a `created`
   timestamp newer than `jira_synced_at` in `task.md`, labeled "New since last
   sync". If no new comments exist, skip silently.
4. Update `jira_synced_at` in `task.md` to the current timestamp.

## Create task

1. Use `next_task_id` from the probe output.
2. Derive a short title and kebab-case slug.
3. Draft the task body from the user's request, carrying a `## Why` section
   when the request already includes a clear motivation worth preserving.
4. Create `.hyper/tasks/T<N>-<slug>/task.md` from `templates/task.md` with:
   - `phase: intake`
   - `scope: unknown`
   - `bugfix: false`
   - `awaiting: null`
4a. (Conditional — only when both conditions hold) If `.hyper/epics.md` exists and the
    user's request includes `--epic E<N>` or equivalent phrasing assigning this new task
    to an epic at creation time: write `epic: E<N>` to the new `task.md` frontmatter, and
    name the folder `E<N>T<M>-<slug>` instead of `T<M>-<slug>`. Update the `epics.md`
    Tasks column to include the new task id. When neither condition holds, task creation
    is identical to the standard flow.
4b. (Conditional) If the user's request begins with `yolo` (case-insensitive,
    followed by a space and the task details): strip the leading `yolo` word
    from the request before deriving the title and slug, and write `yolo: true`
    to the new `task.md` frontmatter. When the prefix is absent, omit the
    field entirely — do not write `yolo: false`.
5. Seed `dashboard.md` from `templates/dashboard.md`, filling `## Goal` from
   the drafted task body.
6. Announce: `Created T<N> — <title>. Starting intake phase.`
   If `.hyper/repo.md` exists, also emit: `"Tip: Run \`hyper-sync pull\` first to get the latest team state before creating tasks."`

## Dispatch phase

Before dispatching:

- if `awaiting != null` and this turn is not a substantive reply to the open
  gate, surface the gate and stop
- if `phase: deferred`, set `phase: intake` and continue

Route by `phase`:

| `phase` | Next step |
|---------|-----------|
| `intake` | Invoke the `hyper-intake` skill. |
| `spec` | Invoke the `hyper-spec` skill. |
| `technical-plan` | Invoke the `hyper-technical-plan` skill. |
| `execution-plan` | Invoke the `hyper-execution-plan` skill. |
| `research` | Invoke the `hyper-research` skill. |
| `implement` | Invoke the `hyper-implement` skill. |
| `verify` | Invoke the `hyper-verify` skill. |
| `docs` | Invoke the `hyper-docs` skill. |
| `review` | Invoke the `hyper-code-review` skill. |
| `done` | Report completion and stop. |
| `cancelled` | Report cancellation and stop. |

When re-dispatching on a gate reply, clear `task.md` `awaiting` before
invoking the phase skill. The phase skill will reapply it via its next verdict
if needed.

## After the phase returns

Apply the verdict mapping in `reference/gates.md` §Verdict vocabulary and the
redirect mapping in `reference/gates.md` §Phase transition table (the
redirect rows live inside that section).

The `implement -> technical-plan` redirect is the only transition that
retains its trigger artifact across the dispatch boundary: on
`redirect target: technical-plan` from `implement`, do not delete
`plan-conflict.md`; it is the input to the next technical-plan dispatch.
`hyper-implement` deletes it on the subsequent re-entry per its re-entry
behavior.

### YOLO gate overrides

When `task.md` has `yolo: true` and a phase returns `awaiting-approval` from
`technical-plan` or `execution-plan`, do not set `awaiting: user-approval` and
stop. Instead:

1. Invoke the `hyper-team` skill with: the written artifact
   (`03-technical-plan.md` or `04-execution-plan.md`), upstream context
   (`01-intake.md` and `02-spec.md` when present), the task goal from
   `task.md`, and a request for a verdict: `approve`, `needs-changes`, or
   `no-consensus`.
2. On `Verdict: approve`: treat as if the user replied "continue". Clear
   `awaiting`, re-dispatch the phase skill; it returns `phase-complete`. Apply
   the normal phase transition.
3. On `Verdict: needs-changes`: re-dispatch the phase skill with the proxy's
   findings as a change request (attach findings as context). The skill revises
   the artifact and returns `awaiting-approval`. Re-enter step 1. If the proxy
   returns `needs-changes` a second consecutive time without an `approve`,
   stop for the user with the proxy's findings and set `awaiting: user-input`.
4. On `Verdict: no-consensus`: stop for the user immediately. Set
   `awaiting: user-input` and surface the proxy's rationale.

All other verdicts from `technical-plan` and `execution-plan` (`awaiting-input`,
`phase-complete`, `redirect target: <phase>`) follow the standard contract
unchanged regardless of `yolo`.

`yolo` never suppresses the `intake` or `spec` approval gates: those elicit user
intent, which a proxy cannot substitute for. See `reference/gates.md`
§Gates that always fire regardless of `yolo`.

### Regenerate dashboard

After applying the verdict and any phase transition, regenerate `dashboard.md`
per `reference/dashboard.md` before announcing or stopping.

Skip dashboard generation for `scope: code-review`.

### Announce open gates

When the updated task has `awaiting: user-approval`, stop with an approval
message, not just a status report. Include:

- `T<N>`, the current `phase`, and `awaiting: user-approval`
- the approval artifact the user should review
- one `[RECOMMENDED — <reason>]` line per `reference/gates.md`
- exact resume options: `approve` or `continue` accepts the artifact; a change
  request revises it
- what approval does next according to the transition table, including archive
  when approval completes a research task

Do not rely on file attachment cards or state-probe facts as the approval ask.

When the updated task has `awaiting: user-input`, stop by asking the one open
question from the phase artifact. Include `T<N>`, the current `phase`, and
`awaiting: user-input`.

### Continue deterministic transitions

When the updated `phase` is non-terminal and `awaiting: null`, re-enter
**Dispatch phase** in the same turn. This applies to ordinary phase-complete
transitions and redirects. Stop only when a gate is open, routing is ambiguous,
the task is terminal, or the next phase itself returns a user-facing approval
or input verdict.

Do not ask the user for a bare "continue" on deterministic transitions such as
`implement -> verify`, `verify -> docs`, `verify -> implement`, or
`implement -> technical-plan`. The destination phase owns any real question or
approval gate.

### Archive on terminal

When a transition sets `phase: done`:

**Jira archive steps** (conditional — only when `task.md` has a `jira_key`
field and `.hyper/jira.md` exists):

Read `mode` from `.hyper/jira.md`. Use the agent's Jira MCP tools if
`mode: mcp`; use direct HTTP REST calls to `docker_url` with env vars
`JIRA_USER`/`JIRA_TOKEN` if `mode: docker`.

1. Generate a `jira.md` completion comment in the task folder:
   - Frontmatter: `jira_key: <value>`, `written_at: <now>`.
   - `## What was done`: 2–4 sentence summary drawn from `task.md` title, the
     task body goal paragraph, and the overall arc of the phase work.
   - `## Key decisions`: bullet list from the `## Decisions` section of
     `dashboard.md`. Include only rows with a date (non-empty rows).
   - `## Notes for QA`: include only if `checks.md` contains QA-relevant notes.
2. When `yolo: true`: post the `jira.md` body (not the frontmatter) as a Jira
   comment automatically without asking. When `yolo` is absent or false: show
   the generated `jira.md` to the developer and ask:
   `"Post this comment to <jira_key>? [y/N]"`
3. If confirmed: post the `jira.md` body (not the frontmatter) as a Jira
   comment. If declined: skip the post; still proceed with the transition.
   (Step 3 applies only when `yolo` is absent or false. In YOLO mode, step 2
   posts directly and step 3 is skipped.)
4. Transition the Jira issue status to the value of `done_transition` from
   `.hyper/jira.md` (default `"QA Test"`). If the transition fails, report the
   error and continue — do not abort archiving.
5. (Conditional — only when `auto_commit: true` in `.hyper/jira.md`)
   a. Compose the commit message:
      - Line 1: `<JIRA-KEY>: <task title from task.md>`
      - Blank line
      - Lines 3–5: the `## What was done` body from the `jira.md` generated in
        step 1, trimmed to 1–3 lines.
   b. `git add -A -- ':(exclude).hyper' && git commit -m "<message>"`
      The `:(exclude).hyper` pathspec ensures `.hyper/` state files are never
      staged into the project repo commit, regardless of `.gitignore` settings.
   c. If the commit fails (nothing to commit, not a git repo, etc.), print:
      `"Auto-commit skipped: <reason>."` and continue — do not abort archiving.

Then archive the task folder per `reference/archive.md` before announcing
completion.
If `.hyper/repo.md` exists, emit: `"Task archived. Run \`hyper-sync push\` to share with your team."`When a transition sets `phase: done`, archive the task folder per
`reference/archive.md` before announcing completion.
